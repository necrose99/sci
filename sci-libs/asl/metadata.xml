  Advanced Simulation Library (ASL) is a free and open source
  multiphysics simulation software package. Its computational
  engine is based, among others, on the Lattice Boltzmann Methods
  and is written in OpenCL which enable extraordinarily efficient
  deployment on a variety of massively parallel architectures,
  ranging from inexpensive FPGAs, DSPs and GPUs up to heterogeneous
  clusters and supercomputers. The engine is hidden entirely behind
  C++ classes, so that no OpenCL knowledge is required from
  application programmers. ASL can be utilized to model various
  coupled physical and chemical phenomena and employed in a
  multitude of fields: computational fluid dynamics, virtual
  sensing, industrial process data validation and reconciliation,
  image-guided surgery, computer-aided engineering,
  high-performance scientific computing, etc.
